<td><b>Anne Bonny</b></td>
<td>1698-1782</td>
<td>1719-1720</td>
<td>Irish</td>
<td><em>She was a Caribbean pirate. Married to James Bonny, who was a pirate. She then had an affair with John "Calico Jack" Rackham, joining his crew. Bonny was discovered by another member of the crew, Mark Read (Mary Read) who was also a woman. Afterwards, the two became very close. Went to prison in 1720.

<td><b>Mary Read</b></td>
<td>c. 1690-1721</td>
<td>1718-1720</td>
<td>English</td>
<td><em>She was a pirate in the Caribbean who disguised herself as a man. Originally, she joined the British army and fought in the War of The Spanish Succession.

<td>Chinese</td>
<td><em>She was a pirate in the water of the South China Sea. Originally a prostitute, she married a pirate and then became the leader after his death. Ching I Sao is regarded as the most powerful pirate in all of human history. She commanded over 1,800 pirate ships, and an estimated 80,000 men. In comparison, Blackbeard commanded four ships and only 300 pirates within the same century. Interestingly enough, after years of piracy, China offered her peace in 1810 and she retired, marrying her second in command.</em></td>

During the time in which Delahaye faked her own death, she hid as a man for a few years before returning to piracy. While there is a lack of sources from the time of her life due to the fact that stories of her exploits were verbally spread, Delahaye became a legendary pirate.</em></td>

<tr>
<td><b>Teuta of Illyria</b></td>
<td>~</td>
<td>232-228 BC</td>
<td>Illyrian</td>
<td><em>Considered the "Pirate Queen" of antiquity; however, she was not a pirate herself. Rather, she was a strong advocate of her nation's right to piracy. Her navy was considerably powerful, and she pushed Illyria's power into the Ionian Sea. Illyrian pirates had total freedom to raid the ships and shores of close nations. Teuta refused a Roman negotitaion to end piracy,and even had one of two ambassadors killed.</em></td>
